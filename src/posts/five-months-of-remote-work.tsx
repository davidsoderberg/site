        In the beginning of April this year(2022) I started at Novu after almost
        5 months since they reached out to hire me and now almost 5 months have
        passed since I started. I will now dive deep down in those 5 months and
        try to figure out what I have learned and why I really enjoy working
        remote and with Novu.

        Due to Covid-19 pandemic I worked remote 3 days a week and 2 days in
        office, we were allowed to work full time but an empty office is not fun
        to be in to be honest. When Covid-19 was at its worst in Sweden I worked
        fully remote and did not like it all... I missed being in an office and
        meeting my collegues during coffe and lunch breaks. This was one of my
        fear joining Novu, that I would feel the same here. But it turned out to
        be the opposite. As no one had an "office" to go to I do not miss it at
        all. Do I like to have a desk in an open office area? No not at all,
        call me lazy or anti-social but working remote solves a lot of the daily
        logistics. I do not need to travel to an office, I do not need to
        prepare a lunchbox (I have my kitchen behind me when I am working,
        literally).

        Communication is hard even in a "office company" and it is not easier in
        a fully remote company. But my opinion right now about it is that the
        communication is better in Novu then any other company I have been in. I
        think it is because we all work remote and do not think anyone knows
        what I know so it is needed to be communicated. I do not say we are best
        in the world on communication but I think it is good because of being
        fully remote and also harder because of fully remote.

        This was not a topic I was afriad of starting at Novu, but when we
        decieded to make the engineering channel public in our Discord I got a
        bit afriad because sometimes you ask a "stupied" question because you
        lazy or are not able to figure it out (rubber ducking). This fear is now
        gone and none existing, the public engineering channel is great because
        sometimes you get feedback from the community instead of your collegues
        and it might be even more insights full. The community at Novu is great,
        we have so many dedicated community members and contributers that makes
        Novus product better faster then the engineering team would ever be able
        to do. So if you are a community member and are reading this, thank
        you...

        If you would have asked me six years ago if I would work in a company
        that only speaks English I would with out a doubt say no. Because my
        English teacher in High School told me that my English is not good
        enough and when you do not practice something it does not get any
        better. When writing this I feel as if I defenitly are speaking two
        languages fluently and I have had a friend from USA for five years now
        that have really helped me get to where I am now.

        With a fully remote company I have the privilege of being able to have
        collegues all over the world. This is one of the best thing to me
        because I have learned so much about people living in other countries
        and also about my own countries laws that might be natural to me but not
        to others. I am learing about different cultures and religons that I
        would never been able to learn in school, like that people in Israel do
        have weekend on Friday and Saturday.

        Oh my this header is a privilege to have in this post, the people at
        Novu is amazing. Nothing and I mean nothing feels bad to say or to do
        because they always support me or anyone in the company. I meet two of
        them two months ago and in like one week I will meet most of them in
        Cyprus and I am so EXCITED becuase people that are amazing remote must
        be even more amazing IRL right?
