        Five months have passed and half of the company trip to Cyprus have
        almost passed... I am writing this on a boat trip and enjoying being
        with my colleagues and the view is amazing. When this is published I
        might be on my way back to Sweden. But let's start from the beginning...

        After 11 hours of travel I finally arrived to the hotel and met all my
        colleagues that I have never met and it was awesome to finally meet
        people that iI have never met and what can I say more than that they are
        amazing in so many ways.

        First evening at the hotel was amazing we had a great dinner with a head
        waiter that was amazing.

        The day after was the first full day and I woke up and realised that I
        was going to present today, after a few minutes of adjustments I headed
        down for a breakfast that is like a two part breakfast. First part is
        cheeses and hams together with bread, second half is a small menu with a
        lot of different egg dishes. We started with a welcome talk with info
        about the week on Cyprus and in Limassol. Then it was my time to talk
        about productivity and how I try to accomplish that. Then we had lunch
        and we did go through the roadmap. After that it was time to head out on
        the streets of Limassol with a guide and the city is really nice
        specially the old parts.

        Second day already and the hardest day for me because we was outside
        like all day and I am not used the brights sun and the heat. But making
        food together instructed by a local guy was really nice even if it was
        to hot sometimes for me. This evening we did eat at a what felt like a
        popular place even for the local people and we ordered metze which
        basically is a lot of food.

        Now it is Sunday and usually this is my lazy day and it started lazy for
        me because I did not go to beach, instead I stayed at the hotel with two
        of my colleagues and did some small work things... We had a quick lunch
        and then we headed out for a boat cruise which was amazing, it gave me a
        huge feeling of freedom. My biggest fear was that it going to be hot but
        cause of the wind and the boat moving it was not, instead it was just
        perfect for a guy like me coming from the Scandinavian countries.

        Monday and a new week starting, we started it with talking about what
        values we have inside of Novu and then we talked about personas. After
        lunch we had a R&amp;D workshop and it was great, I think we need to do
        more of those kind of stuff... That evening we had a nice snack and beer
        session together in the lobby of the hotel and it was really nice to
        have something more relaxed.

        When I am writing most of this post Tuesday was yesterday and it was a
        very interesting day with communication, marketing and product
        workshops.

        In the evening we headed out to get asian food in the end I ended up
        having baous and buns and they tasted good. Then we did go to a bar for
        a few drinks, a few people and me stayed a bit longer and had ice cream
        from Israel before we headed back to the hotel.

        Last full day togther at Cyprus, the morning started with another small
        session about communication and then we talked about Hacktober fest and
        many otherthings that will happen in October... Last but not least we
        had a discussion session about improvement on our agile process.

        After lunch we took a taxi to center of Limassol to get a tour with a
        lot of food. It was great but the biggest problem was that the guide
        talked Hebrew sometimes and the whole team told her to speak engligsh so
        that I can understand her. After like 4-5 time she talked Hebrew I
        honestly stopped listen to her. The night at the hotel most of us stayed
        up a bit later then previous.

        Thursday, today have been tough for me not because of the heat or
        because people do not speak a language I understand sometimes. No
        because I knew I had to leave the people that feels like a family to
        me... We did eat breakfast togther in a seperated room and it was great,
        hard not feel emotional sometimes during people speaks about us as a
        group or about the week we have had togther.

        At 13:00 I had to take a taxi to the airport where I am writing this
        from and it was not easy (emotional), I was lucky that the driver was
        very social so we spoke the entire way to the airport.

        In my last post I wrote "people that are amazing remote must be even
        more amazing IRL right" and let me tell you I was not even close to be
        right (amazing is not enough to describe them), the people I have had
        the pleasure to spend a week with and it is hard to go home and seeing
        these people more then online becase I feel as if we really connected
        during this week. With that said I hope I soon will see most of them in
        Israel in a couple of months. I have learned a lot of being in a company
        where all of the people care about everyone and about the company. My
        view on Novu members is that they are in Novu not because it is just a
        work it is something much larger and something that every single one of
        us is putting everything into.

        I know there will be another offsite as this next year and that I will
        go to Israel soon but this will leave a feeling of emptiness. Do not get
        me wrong, I am not sad or anything, it just a feeling that tells me I
        had an amazing time and now I am going back to normal that feels a bit
        boring, but I know we need it to enjoy weeks like the week I just had.

        A door that I like to call Novu opened almost 10 months ago for me, this
        week have opened alot of doors between the members of Novu and the door
        for the future of Novu is wide open.
