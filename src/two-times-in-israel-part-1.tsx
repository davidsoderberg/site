        I see myself as any swedish guy, I dreamed about being a fire fighter or
        police officer when I was like 4-5 years old, I did not have any sports
        dream but I did dream about being on stage as a magician instead. I did
        school and high scool with okay grades and passed university with
        nothing outstanding.

      <p>
        Got a job during my exam internship and worked for that company 1 year
        and 7 months (7 months in Stockholm, the rest on distance). Changed to a
        company more local to me, worked there for almost exatly five years. I
        have had 2-3 girlfriends and have my own apartment (not renting). My
        parents are in professions with okay salaries, I have a brother that is
        in okay distance age wise and he is doing good as well.

        When I got the question if I would like to join Novu it feelt like a
        scam, it was to good to be true. Two guys from Israel have seen my small
        contribution to their repository and now the liked to hire me with a
        much better salary and options of doing a lot of traveling and meeting
        other people from the whole world. After a month of discussions and
        thinking I decided to trust these guys and signed. About two months
        later I had a meeting with the person that would help me getting my work
        computer (at this point it feelt a bit more real...). Third of April I
        did my first day in Novu and a month later my first salary showed up and
        now it was real to me. Most of what happend after that you already know
        about until I came home from Cyprus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Cyprus I have been in Israel two times, before I decided to go my
        first time my head went crazy about if I should go or not. The picture
        of Israel is not great to be honest (and not entirely true to be
        honest). I have always valued my life highly and was scared about the
        bombing and shooting that have happend and happens in Israel. In the end
        my thinking was okay I have 8 collegues living in Israel and if they can
        be in Israel I can be as well.
      </p>

        So with that in mind I booked flight tickets and was going to stay at a
        Galis apartment with her planing what we should visit and see. So
        Thursday first of december I did go by train and airplaine to end up in
        Tel Aviv. My collegue Gali picked me up at the airport and we did go by
        train to central of Tel Aviv and then took the buss to get to the part
        where she is living with her boyfriend at the time (this is important
        for future reading). We had a meal at restaurant with good food and
        great beer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day we started to plan the dinner for this evening with all
        collegues and their plus one. I made a mushroom pizza that made a great
        success in the group, we had a lot of food and fun this night.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first two days I thought I had sweat a lot but wait it get worse...
      </p>
      <p>
        Saturday and my first day as a tourist, me, Gali and another collegue
        traveled by car and visited the deadsea, desert and had pizza at Galis
        parents house that was the best pizza in very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it is Sunday and a working day in Israel so we (me and Gali) had a
        productive day at work and in the evening another collegue joined us for
        an happy hour with a lot of alcohol and great discussions. Monday was
        another working day and most of the day did go to interviews and resting
        the hang over away ðŸ˜›
      </p>
      <p>
        Tuesday and we did go to the old train station of Tel Aviv to have an
        amazing breakfast, after it we walked at the beach to get a beer. We
        meet up with another collegue to have hummus as lunch and it was great.
        We then walked around in this amazing food market and headed of to the
        old part of Tel Aviv here we had an amazing sweet treat and the old part
        is just amazing looking. This evening I spent alone in Galis apartment
        because she and her boyfriend had to go to the venue place of their
        future wedding (see I told you it was important ðŸ˜› ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day we took the train to Jerusalem, we did see the food market of
        Jersualem where I had my favorite thing wich is Shakshuka, after that we
        headed to the famous wall and the old city of King David (sorry it is
        not mine city ðŸ˜‰ ). Here is when I got so sweaty that I thought I had
        lost all water inside of my body but no. When we asked the guide if we
        should take the buss back or take another route. They recommended us
        taking the other route it would be narrow but not more narrow as the
        route we already had done. Well that was a misstake, because I had to
        crawl, go in squat position and got very dirty... After that I had my
        first angy moment in english at the manager of it. After this we decided
        to go home to Tomer another collegue and had an amazing dinner out with
        beer and drinks. We took the late buss home and I really needed that
        night of sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thursday and I am traveling home today, right before we headed of to the
        airport we had a beer or two. At the airport I had a hard time to pass
        the first security check because I was sweating and shaking a bit
        because of some medicins. After passed that one the rest was easy and I
        stayed at the hotel in Copenhagen before taking the train back home the
        day after.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am honered, moved, lucky and very happy with having such a great
        collegues in Israel and that I now call my friends. Special thanks to
        Gali and her boyfriend (see you in Sweden soon) and thanks to the other
        collegues that made my first trip to Israel an bless.
